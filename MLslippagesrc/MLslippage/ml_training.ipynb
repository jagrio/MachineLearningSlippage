    "######==================== CURRENT CODE USAGE ======================================================================\n",
    "# -> Current code trains several ML Classifiers, to classify force input samples as stable (0) or slip (1)\n",
    "######---- Input\n",
    "# -> Input samples originate from optoforce sensors and are 3D (fx,fy,fz) and come from 3 different datasets, \n",
    "# containing several surfaces as well as slip-stable occurrences\n",
    "######---- Input transformation\n",
    "# -> Several pre-features are taken from these inputs.\n",
    "# -> Several time and frequency domain features are extracted from pre-feature windows. \n",
    "# (implemented in 'newfeatext.py') These windows have size w and are shifted by s on each sample\n",
    "# -> Then a feature selection-ranking is performed using MutualVariableInformation\n",
    "# -> Finally PCA is performed to keep the desired among the best selected features\n",
    "######---- Training of ML Classifiers\n",
    "# -> Several ML Classifiers are trained for all combinations of features-datasets\n",
    "######---- Stats report\n",
    "# -> Several stats are reported on the classification results of the trained models, \n",
    "# based on their accuracy (fscore and auc as well) on test data as well as previously unseen data\n",
    "######===================== POTENTIAL CODE EXTENSION FOR FURTHER MORE GENERIC USAGE ================================\n",
    "# -> As binary classification problem it may apply to all such problems given that:\n",
    "######----- Input\n",
    "# -> Input is loaded on datasets, which expect (n,1) input with (k,4) dimensions each,\n",
    "# where n data samples, k measurement in each sample, 3 force readings and 1 label for each measurement.\n",
    "######----- Input transformation\n",
    "# -> Pre-features must be changed or ommitted to fit your needs. \n",
    "# Here they served to transform the 3 (fx,fy,fz) force readings into one between (ft,fn,ft/fn,sf)\n",
    "# -> Features are performed on the desired pre-features. They take a (n,o,m) input matrix and return a (n,o,l),\n",
    "# where n data samples, o windows, m prefeatures, l features.\n",
    "# -> Feature selection gives a ranking on each l, so we keep b from the best\n",
    "# -> PCA is performed on the b selected features resulting in p dimensions (n,o,p) => (n*o,p)\n",
    "######----- Training of ML Classifiers\n",
    "# -> Each Classifier is trained on a subset of (n*o,p)\n",
    "######----- Stats\n",
